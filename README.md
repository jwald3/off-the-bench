Off The Bench is an NFL stat website that provides users with a research tool to make granularly-defined queries for player and team stats. In addition to basic player and team stats, the web app supports breakdowns for personnel usage, team tendencies, target and backfield shares, and snap counts. OTB is designed by and for football fans looking to gain an edge in fantasy sports, betting, and debates.

The R package "NFLverse" provides stats for Off The Bench's tables and charts. Before being uploaded to the PostgreSQL database, the stats are sanitized and aggregated in Python using the Pandas library. Prisma connects the app with the database as the project's ORM.

Third-party libraries, including MaterialUI and Recharts, enhance the project's storytelling capabilities with powerful and interactive visualizations. MaterialUI's Datagrid component delivers tables with native support for sorting, filtering, and exporting data, while Recharts' BarChart component gives clear summaries based on data.

Additional features are coming soon, but feel free to suggest any ideas you may have!
